<time>03 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>FOR more than a decade, the Joe Rogan Experience has been one of the most popular podcasts in the world, receiving millions of views per episode as its titular host interviews a wide array of guests.</p><p>From billionaire <a href=#>Elon Musk</a> to whistleblower <a href=#>Edward Snowden</a>, <a href=#>Joe Rogan</a> has had thousands of entertaining conversations that have captivated his listeners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/dd534fa9-40c0-4a48-bd26-16b73268e263.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/taken-without-permission-experience-inside-821461336.jpg><p>But with a host as opinionated as Rogan, and with thousands of interviews under his belt, there are bound to be some episodes where feathers are ruffled.</p><p>Rogan has gotten into his fair share of arguments with guests, often creating awkward or intense moments on the show.</p><p>Many of these arguments have gone viral with fans commending Rogan for his staying calm and composed most of the time.</p><p>The U.S. Sun has listed some of Rogan's most heated arguments over the years.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE JOE ROGAN">READ MORE JOE ROGAN</h2><h2>EDDIE BRAVO</h2><p>One of the few times Rogan lost his cool was in a 2017 episode with JRE regular, Eddie Bravo.</p><p>Bravo, a martial arts instructor and comedian, is a known believer in <a href=#>conspiracy theories</a>, particularly that <a href=#>the Earth is flat</a> which sparked a debate between him and Rogan.</p><p>In the episode, Bravo asked Rogan and his team to show him "a real picture" of the Earth from space but immediately deemed it as being "fake."</p><p>"Why does it look fake?" Rogan asked, to which Bravo answered that the image looks something he would see in a movie.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>"That's because when they do it in a movie, they try to look like this which is what looks real," Rogan tried to explain.</p><p>The two men went back and forth, with Bravo claiming that images of a round Earth were "propaganda" but could not provide Rogan <a href=#>an image of a flat Earth</a> when he asked for it.</p><p>After about 40 minutes, Rogan snapped at Bravo, calling his beliefs "insane."</p><p>"Eddie you're talking about the Earth being flat!" he shouted. "Thousands of scientists have looked into it, you think they're all wrong? That's so insane!"</p><p>Bravo responded: "You haven't looked into it."</p><h2>DAVE PORTNOY</h2><p>Things got spicy again in an episode featuring Barstool Sports founder, <a href=#>Dave Portnoy</a>, that aired earlier this year.</p><p>Things got heated up when the men were talking about sports, particularly boxing and Portnoy argued that <a href=#>Tommy Fury</a>, the younger brother of professional boxer <a href=#>Tyson Fury</a>, wasn't "a real boxer."</p><p>Portnoy claimed that Tommy was only famous due to his brother's name, saying, "We would not know who Tommy Fury was if his last name wasn't 'Fury'."</p><p>"Probably we wouldn't know as much about him," Rogan agreed, adding, "But still he's a good-looking guy, he's built great, you know, he looks the part."</p><p>The conversation was mostly amicable in the beginning until tensions began to rise as the men watched clips of Tommy Fury boxing with Rogan complimenting him and Portnoy disagreeing.</p><p>"The guy's fighting looks good. You're crazy if you don't think Tommy Fury is a <a href=#>boxer</a>," Rogan said.</p><p>However, Portnoy kept calling for another video to be played and Rogan got agitated, yelling at Portnoy to "watch this!"</p><h2>BRIAN DUNNING</h2><p>Rogan sat down with author <a href=#>Brian Dunning</a> in 2014 years after he wrote an article claiming that Rogan promoted harmful <a href=#>pseudoscience</a>.</p><p>From the beginning of the episode, it's clear that Rogan seems irritated with his guest and tries to counter Dunning's talking points.</p><p>For three hours, the men argued back and forth about everything with Rogan calling Dunning's points "factually inaccurate on so many different levels."</p><p>"I don't understand why you wrote it like that," he said. "There are things that you said that I believe that I don't. That I've never said that I do."</p><p>However, Dunning clapped back at Rogan, arguing that several claims he makes on the <a href=#>podcast</a> are done without prior research.</p><p>"I'm sorry, you're against all reasonably-established science and you're trying to make a buck off of people potentially getting killed and I have a huge problem with that," said Dunning.</p><h2>STEVEN CROWDER</h2><p>Rogan's booze-filled encounter with fellow podcast host, <a href=#>Steven Crowder</a> in a 2017 episode of JRE is perhaps the most well-known verbal altercation he's ever gotten into.</p><p>Both men had a few drinks throughout the episode, which many fans believe led to the "unhinged" argument the two got into about <a href=#>marijuana use and legalization</a>.</p><p>Rogan has often been vocal about the legalization of marijuana, believing it holds several benefits, however, Crowder opposes the use of the <a href=#>drug</a>.</p><p>Crowder argued that the legalization of weed led to an increase in motor vehicle accidents, to which Rogan told him to <a href=#>Google</a> to see if it was true.</p><p>Rogan pulled up a 2014 <a href=# aria-label="Washington Post op-ed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Post op-ed</a> that claimed that highway fatalities were at near-historic lows in <a href=#>Colorado</a> following the legalization of marijuana.</p><p>However, Crowder accused Rogan of pulling for sources that he "wanted" to find.</p><p>But their civil debate spiraled into a 40-minute argument with Crowder calling Rogan "a bully" and saying that he was being "hostile."</p><p>After the episode aired, Rogan issued an apology to Crowder, saying that the show "went off the rails."</p><p>"First of all, I genuinely like Steven as a person, and although I might not agree with him about everything I think he's a good man," he <a href=# aria-label="wrote (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I take 100% responsibility for it going off the rails, and I'm truly sorry if it upset any of you that listened to it or watched it. We managed to pull it back together at the end, but of course, the s****y parts are all you or I will focus on for a while.</p><p>"My humblest and most heartfelt apologies. I do my best with these things but I, like all of us, am flawed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/764313df-1378-4cb2-af29-ff1535804cce.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/photo-illustration-joe-rogan-experience-821461419.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdoZ4B4hJJvZqOnlWK%2FsLPAp2SesKCav6qxzZycZqWfqMFutMSaq56cXaW8pa%2FArKtmn6WawLW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-joe-rogan-s-most-intense-arguments-with-podcast-guests-from-eddie-bravo-flat-earth-theory-to.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-joe-rogan-s-most-intense-arguments-with-podcast-guests-from-eddie-bravo-flat-earth-theory-to.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-joe-rogan-s-most-intense-arguments-with-podcast-guests-from-eddie-bravo-flat-earth-theory-to.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-joe-rogan-s-most-intense-arguments-with-podcast-guests-from-eddie-bravo-flat-earth-theory-to.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-joe-rogan-s-most-intense-arguments-with-podcast-guests-from-eddie-bravo-flat-earth-theory-to.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-joe-rogan-s-most-intense-arguments-with-podcast-guests-from-eddie-bravo-flat-earth-theory-to.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kanye-west-might-have-done-the-impossible-on-no-more-parties-in-la.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kanye-west-might-have-done-the-impossible-on-no-more-parties-in-la.html>Kanye West Might Have Done The Impossible On &amp;quot;No More Parties In LA&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./i-love-euphoria-s-fez-and-lexi-but-maybe-i-shouldn-t.html>I Love Euphoria's Fez and Lexi but Maybe I Shouldn't</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./i-love-euphoria-s-fez-and-lexi-but-maybe-i-shouldn-t.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
