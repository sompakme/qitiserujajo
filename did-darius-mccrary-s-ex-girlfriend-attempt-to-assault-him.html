Recently, he sought a restraining order against his ex-girlfriend, alleging that she physically attacked him and damaged his car’s windows with a lead pipe.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>The Denied Restraining Order</strong></h3><p>At first, the court denied the temporary restraining order. The reason? McCrary failed to appear on the scheduled hearing date. However, he later explained that he felt “displaced” and had to escape from his ex’s presence. In court documents, McCrary revealed that he is “emotionally scarred” and unable to focus on his work or daily activities due to fear. Shockingly, he claims that the abuse he endured included physical, verbal, and mental torment, and he suspects the use of narcotics in these abusive acts.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Past Marital Struggles</strong></h3><p>Darius McCrary’s love life has been far from smooth sailing, marked by multiple relationships and marriages that ended in turmoil.

Within three months, they got engaged and were married in 200Regrettably, their marriage was marred by allegations of domestic and physical abuse, leading to their divorce in 2011.</p><h3><strong>Troubled Marriage to a Basketball Player</strong></h3><p>In 2014, McCrary married Tammy Brawner, a basketball player. However, their union quickly soured, with Brawner accusing the actor of domestic abuse. In her divorce petition to the Los Angeles Superior Court, she described him as “violent, destructive, and emotionally unstable.” She further alleged that he neglected their child and struggled with substance addiction. McCrary’s attorney vehemently denied these allegations, labeling Brawner as a “predator.” Despite their divorce in 2019, the custody battle over their child raged on, ultimately granting Brawner full custody and allowing McCrary limited supervised visitation.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>An Engagement Shrouded in Mystery</strong></h3><p>Despite his rocky romantic past, McCrary recently revealed that he is engaged once again.
