The Netflix reality series—which, if you've been living under a rock, follows several couples as they get engaged sight unseen and decide whether to get married within a month—reached the peak of its notoriety with the release of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/love-is-blind-season-4/>season 4</a>, which took over the Internet last spring, between its steady stream of social media discourse and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/love-is-blind-season-4-reunion-special-live/>semi-live reunion</a>. Since the fourth season concluded last April, past contestants have accused the production company behind the show of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/love-is-blind-mistreatment-accusations/>gross mistreatment</a>, spawning another round of discussion for whether viewers should support the show. (Kinetic Connect refuted the claims in a subsequent statement.) However, the announcement of season 4 After the Altar and season 5 has confirmed it: Love Is Blind isn't going everywhere, and we're all (enthusiastically or not) along for the ride.</p><p>In fact, the streaming giant is doubling down on their reality hit, with both After the Altar and season 5 arriving with the shortest break in between seasons yet. (Though part of that may have to do with the writers' and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/celebrities-react-actors-strike/>actors' strikes</a>.) As details are gradually released over the next month, TV fans will have to prepare ourselves for LIB to take over our TikTok and Twitter (or X, I guess) feeds once again. Below, we're keeping track of everything we learn.</p><h2 id=when-does-39-love-is-blind-39-season-5-come-out-3>When does 'Love Is Blind' season 5 come out?</h2><p>Season 5 will mark a return to the show's shorter format, only consisting of 10 episodes (which we're not mad at). The first four episodes will drop on Friday, September 22, followed by episodes 5-7 drop on Friday, September 29; episodes 8-9 on Friday, October 6; and the weddings on Friday, October 13.</p><h2 id=when-is-the-39-love-is-blind-39-season-5-reunion-3>When is the 'Love Is Blind' season 5 reunion?</h2><p>Don't worry LIB fans—<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/are-stacy-izzy-still-together-love-is-blind/>Season 5</a> will have a reunion, and it won't be live this time. Netflix just announced that the special episode will premiere on Sunday, October 15, at 8 pm ET/ 5 pm PT, two days <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/are-lydia-milton-together-now-love-is-blind/>after the finale</a> hits the streamer. Though this time slot is the same one from season 4's disastrous live reunion, the streaming giant wants fans to know that this reunion will be pre-taped to avoid any delays. Besides glimpses of this season's cast getting ready for the show, the highlight of the reunion's teaser is a PA marking out the word "live" on a reunion poster with a sharpie. "IT'S NOT LIVE, BUT IT IS UNMISSABLE," the teaser reads.</p><p>Following the announcement, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1387714/love-is-blind-season-5-reunion-first-look-photos-reveal-which-women-are-attending referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>E! News</a> revealed that Stacy Snyder, Lydia Velez Gonzales, Taylor Rue, Aaliyah Cosby, and Johnie Maraist all joined the finale taping. While the men haven't been confirmed, it's highly likely that Izzy Zapata, Milton Johnson, Jared "JP" Pierce, Uche Okoroha, and Chris Fox will also appear on the reunion to hash out all of the season's dramas.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-39-love-is-blind-39-season-5-3>Is there a trailer for 'Love Is Blind' season 5?</h2><p>The first dramatic trailer for season 5 premiered early September, giving a hint at the storylines of the upcoming episodes. While many of the clips are business as usual—participants discussing their dating insecurities, sneak peeks of the proposals—there's also some looks at the post-pod drama, including protective family members doubting the engagements and intense discussions about finances. At one point, the trailer teases a love triangle among the engaged couples, with one man telling another, "She planned for us to both be here because she couldn’t let me go."</p><p>Netflix previously introduced viewers to one of the pod couples during Tudum 2023. The clip showed the two participants (who go unnamed) meeting and sharing their relationship history. (He's been previously engaged, and she has had a string of "crappy" relationships, and she also was previously married.) There's even an "I love you" exchanged.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
