,&nbsp;</span><span>Baseball Tonight</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>College Gameday</span><span>&nbsp;Shows which air on the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN).&nbsp;Here is the Biography of this amazingly experienced journalist including who her husband is and what her salary and net worth could be.</span></p><h2><strong><span>ESPN’s Jen Lada – Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jen Lada was born on January 14, 1981 in Spring Grove, Chicago, USA to Connie and Bill Lada.&nbsp;Her early life was heavily influenced by her athletic father who was an athletic director and her mother who was very much in love with the baseball games.&nbsp;She was bred in the Chicago neighborhood where she received her high school education at Marian Catholics High School in Illinois, Chicago.</span></p><p><span>As a high school student, she excelled in events and was part of her school’s school team and grounds.&nbsp;For her athletic ability, she earned a part-time athletic scholarship to Marquette University to study Broadcast Electronics in the communications department.</span></p><p><span>While at college, she became interested in journalism and was upset when she joined a local newspaper company where she began learning the ropes.&nbsp;After graduating from college, she landed her first job as a general news reporter for the Fox News-affiliated Milwaukee Station, but her stylish delivery of sports stories set her apart as a very good sports reporter.</span></p><p><span>No wonder Comcast SportsNet called her service, where she received her prime assignment as a reporter for the National Football League’s Chicago Bears and Major League Baseball’s Chicago White Sox for WITI-TV.&nbsp;In 2011, the Association of Wisconsin Broadcasters recognized her as the first sport to be named Best Sport for her outstanding reporting.&nbsp;She also received the press club’s first award for her coverage of the Milwaukee runner for multiple sclerosis.</span></p><span>Lada previously worked as a reporter and anchor for WITI-TV in Milwaukee and WREX-TV in Rockford, Illinois.&nbsp;At WITI, she was awarded 1st place for Best Sportscast by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association in 2011.&nbsp;Additionally, her story about a Milwaukee woman who walked across the United States to raise awareness of multiple sclerosis was awarded 1st place for Best Feature by the Milwaukee Press Club.</span><p><span>This remarkable woman in 2015 had her time working for the CSN network, now known as NBC Sports Chicago.&nbsp;There she worked on her charm as the host of the television series Kap and Haugh.&nbsp;Jen Lada and Colin Cowherd had a good synergy covering sports news for the network before he left for Fox News.</span></p><p><span>Her outstanding reporting brought her guest appearances on ESPN’s radio sports programs in collaborations with Mike Greenberg and Golick on radio shows.&nbsp;Haven made a lasting impression on the program with her analytical skills.&nbsp;Jen Lada landed a permanent job with the ESPN network after a delicious offer was made to keep her services.</span></p><p><span>By 2017, Jen Lada had been named as one of the main contributors and hosts of the ESPN network&nbsp;</span><span>Baseball Tonight, College Gameday</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>First Take</span><span>&nbsp;shows.</span></p><p><span>Since Jen Lada’s involvement with ESPN, her stylishly well-articulated stories have garnered recognition and even been nominated for awards, such as Best Feature Story for the College Sports Media Award.</span></p><p><span>This amazing journalist and reporter is not only a sports reporter, but an excellent runner who is not afraid to get her hands on;&nbsp;She has competed in over three marathons, triathlons and cycle races as well as distance races over the years.</span></p><p><span>The 5ft 8in tall mother of two can indeed be discreet when it comes to her family and personal life but is very active on the social media platform where she has garnered a noticeable following, especially on Instagram and Twitter.</span></p><p><strong><span>salary and wealth</span></strong></p><p><span>The Spring Grove native is probably one of the highest paid sports reporters as her salary is estimated to be between $85,000-$100,000 per year while her net worth is fixed at $1 million or more.&nbsp;That’s not a bad sum for a journalist of her caliber.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she married, who is her husband?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The beautiful sportswriter is marriedwoman.&nbsp;She is the wife of Dario Melendez, a sportswriter and reporter who works for a Fox News-affiliated Milwaukee station.&nbsp;They met while on active duty, representing their respective network stations in coverage of the Packers game at Lambeau Field.&nbsp;After dating for a while, they married in 2017 and by February 2018 were the proud parents of a baby girl they named Layla.</span></p><p><span>However, Lada’s marriage to Dario wasn’t hers, first when she was ex-wife Sean Reti, a former college friend and soccer coach with whom she tied the knot in 2006, and three years later in 2009 they welcomed their bundle of joy Chase Reti.&nbsp;However, their joy as a family was short-lived as the couple soon separated.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
