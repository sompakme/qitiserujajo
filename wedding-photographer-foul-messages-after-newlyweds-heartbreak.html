Shows what kind of people you are!!!! Expect some people to turn up to your house and return the favour!!!” a message sent by Ms Johnson’s phone, shared with news.com.au, read.</p><p>Facebook messages sent to Natasha had a similar theme.</p><p>“This is on you guys because you publicly posted … they were in your name,” one read.</p><p>“Oh and don’t forget the other photos and videos I took for you as well.</p><p>“So if you want your photos and all this over remove all posts. The more Ryan posts the more this delays.”</p><p>Ms Johnson was further upset when asked by Natasha to stop contacting her unless it was to hand over the wedding photos.</p><p>“F*** YOU BOTH!!!!” part of another foul message read.</p><p>“You’re not getting anything from me. All my other beautiful clients will receive their images but you no f***ing way.”</p><p>While the couple had since received multiple kind offers from the community to recreate the experience and take fresh photos, they said it wouldn’t be the same given family had flown in from England for the day.</p><p>“Even if we paid to do a fake wedding shoot, it’s not going to be the same, I’m not going to look the same, and parents are not going to fly back over for a fake photo shoot,” Natasha said.</p><p>“I trusted her and let her be part of my day, and trusted her to take the most important photos, and she’s basically taken our money, which we work very hard for.</p><p>“She’s made me think of our wedding with a dark cloud over it. When I think of our wedding, the first thing I think of is Rikky-Leigh.”</p><p>When called by news.com.au, Ms Johnson’s partner answered the phone but swiftly hung up.</p><p>She refused multiple requests for comment across email, Facebook, phone and Instagram.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>A Queensland Police Services spokesperson told news.com.au it was investigating.</p><p>“Police have received a complaint relating to allegations referenced, investigations are ongoing and as such it would be inappropriate to comment further,” they said.</p><p><i>Do you know more?
