The <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-eyeliners/>best eyeliners</a> can make your eyes pop from a mile away with a single swipe across the lids. If playful, bold shapes are your forte, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-liquid-eyeliners/>liquid liners</a> are your best friend. Or maybe you like a subtle smokey look, in which case <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-eyeliner-pencils/>pencil liners</a> are there for you. And if you love to experiment with fun shades, there are even <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g4546/colored-eyeliner/>colored eyeliners</a> out there. But allow me to let you in on another magic use for eyeliner: waterlining.</p><p>Waterlining is a makeup technique in which you apply eyeliner to the wet, fleshy part of your lower inner eyelids. It can change the look of your entire face, says pro makeup artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.jaleesajaikaran.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Jaleesa Jaikaran</a>. “Using a white or neutral liner in the waterline can make you look more awake and take away any look of redness in the eyes,” she says. “On the other hand, using brighter colors that are complementary to your skin tone can emphasize your eyes and make your complexion a bit brighter.” Additionally, you can line your upper inner eyelid, a.k.a. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a18851/tightlining-tips/>tightlining</a>, to make your lashes appear more lush and full.</p><p>If you’re hoping to achieve bigger-looking eyes and fuller lashes, look no further than the best waterline eyeliners. But bear in mind that eyeliner in the waterline can cause dryness for some. "It occludes the openings of the meibomian glands,” says board-certified ophthalmologist,<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.drdianehilalcampo.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> Dr. Diane Hilal-Campo</a>. “This prevents the oils from being released into the tear film. This will cause the patients' eyes to be dry.”</p><p>We at Marie Claire have compiled this list of the very best eyeliners for the waterline—all of which are long-wearing, waterproof, highly pigmented, and, most importantly, have silky smooth textures to prevent irritation in the sensitive area. Read on for expert shopping tips from beauty pros Jaikaran and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.ehlieluna.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Ehlie Luna</a>, and to shop our favorites.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-waterline-eyeliners><span>What to Look For in Waterline Eyeliners</span></h2><p>You can’t just be throwing any eyeliner in your waterline willy-nilly. The waterline is an especially sensitive area, so any tugging or skipping may cause irritation and damage. If you’re looking for an eyeliner specifically to use in your waterline, pro makeup artist Ehlie Luna says silicone-based and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/g3749/waterproof-eyeliners/>waterproof eyeliner</a> formulas are your best bet. “To spot them you might see words like cyclopentasiloxane or trimethylsiloxysilicate listed in the ingredients.” But she gave another pro tip: “You don't have to memorize these words but notice ingredient names with ‘-sil’ buried in them among the first five ingredients. Often they will mention 'waterproof' on the package somewhere.”</p><p>Another quality to look out for? Texture. “The best liner for the waterline is a pencil liner that has a creamy payoff yet is long-lasting,” says Jaikaran. A creamy-textured pencil (like Maybelline’s TattooStudio pencil, below) won’t tug or skip across your waterline, meaning there will be less chance for irritation. Luna also notes that kohl and kajal formulas are often used in the waterline because they are especially creamy.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-eyeliners-for-the-waterline><span>The Best Eyeliners for the Waterline</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Waterproof Eyeliner Pencil" data-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/24-7-glide-on-eye-pencil-P133707 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2F24-7-glide-on-eye-pencil-P133707&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GZUoZEXsuXgYhuQ8RPVhvZ-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Overall Waterline Eyeliner</span></p></a><p>Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Waterproof Eyeliner Pencil</p><p>There's a reason Urban Decay dubs its 24/7 Glide-On Waterproof Pencil as the "#1 Eyeliner in the U.S." Its smudge-proof, ultra-creamy, high-impact formula has won numerous awards including Glamour's 2022 and 2021 <a href=# data-url=https://www.glamour.com/gallery/beauty-awards-readers-choice-product-winners referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Reader's Choice awards</a>, and is pretty much a universal favorite in the beauty world (it's another one of Jaikaran's favorite waterline eyeliners).

She says this drugstore pick is "nice because while it blends easily for a smokey eye or smokey lash line look, it does not budge." In other words, if you need a blendable liner that stays put, this is a good option. This one is specifically resistant to sebum, the oily substance your eyelids produce to protect the surface of your eye, meaning this liner works especially well in the waterline.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Long-wearing; Waterproof; Sebum-resistant; Blendable; Offered in over 10 shades; Highly pigmented.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Dries fast; Difficult to sharpen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer review: "</strong>I've been using this eyeliner for about 10 years now...

After about 30 seconds though, this eyeliner sets in a budge-free, high-impact finish.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Glides easily; Highly pigmented; Offered in eight shades; Waterproof; Long-wearing.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Over $20; Difficult to sharpen.</p><p><strong>Customer review:</strong> "I bought this in ‘barbarella brown’ and it’s a really beautiful deep brown shade. It’s super easy to apply and has good staying power throughout the day. It sets in place quite quickly and I’ve had no issues with smudging, which I have had with other kohl pencils before." — Nordstrom</p><a href=# data-model-name="Hourglass Voyeur Waterproof Gel Eyeliner" data-url=https://www.ulta.com/p/voyeur-waterproof-gel-eyeliner-pimprod2032726? referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvoyeur-waterproof-gel-eyeliner-pimprod2032726%3F&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aH5UVPqBvK4c7L39EY2kvZ-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Vegan Waterline Eyeliner</span></p></a><p>Hourglass Voyeur Waterproof Gel Eyeliner</p><p>MC's very own Fashion E-Commerce Editor, <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/julia-marzovilla/>Julia Marzovilla</a>, counts herself a fan of this eyeliner pencil, saying "The vegan, cruelty-free, and paraben-free formula is so easy to use but it lasts all day—even when you use it in the waterline."
