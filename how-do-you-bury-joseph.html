Place the statue inside the hole upside-down and facing your house. Others insist that the statue should face the road to symbolize the act of leaving the home.</p><h3>What does burying St. Joseph mean?</h3><p>Burying the St. Joseph statue in your yard is believed to help your home sell fast. The earliest accounts of this practice actually reference the statue being buried in order to get someone to sell the property to the one doing the burying.</p><h3>What is the miracle prayer to sell a house?</h3><p>A popular prayer to sell a house is: “I wish to sell this [house/property] quickly, easily, and profitably and I implore you to grant my wish by bringing me a good buyer, one who is eager, compliant, and honest, and by letting nothing impede the rapid conclusion of the sale.”</p><h3>What prayer do you say to bless a house?</h3><p>The Blessing of a New House prayer includes the following: “Lord, send down your mercy and your blessing upon us here and upon this house. May your angel of mercy watch over it and keep all who live here safe from anything that is evil. May he guide us into the fulfillment of your holy will, teaching us to observe what Christ has taught us.”</p><h3>Where to bury a Saint Joseph statue to sell a house?</h3><p>Bury the Saint Joseph statue near the “For Sale” sign or near the road in your yard. Some people also bury it in a flowerpot and place it on a deck or windowsill. The key is to choose a spot that is meaningful to you and that you believe will help sell your house.</p><h3>How do you anoint a house?</h3><p>To anoint your house, mark a cross in the outer walls, windows, floors, ceilings, and doorposts with oil. While doing this, ask God to fill your home with His Holy Spirit and let everything that happens in your home be according to His will.</p><h3>Why is St. Joseph so powerful?</h3><p>St. Joseph is considered powerful because of his role as the head of the Holy Family and the father and protector of Jesus. He made virtuous choices in life and was entrusted with caring for Jesus and Mary. He is often associated with the protection and provision of homes and is believed to intercede in selling properties.</p><h3>Who is the patron saint of home buyers?</h3><p>St. Joseph is often considered the patron saint of home buyers and is invoked for his intercession when buying or selling a house.

He protected Jesus and Mary on their journey to Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus and during their flight to Egypt to protect Jesus from Herod’s evil intent. St. Joseph’s protection extends to those who seek his intercession, offering help and guidance in times of trouble.</p><h3>Can you reuse a St Joseph statue to sell a house?</h3><p>If you find a St. Joseph statue after selling your house, you can reuse it for future house-selling endeavors. Some people also choose not to bury the statue but to keep it in a prominent place in their new home as a symbol of gratitude for St. Joseph’s intercession in selling their previous house.</p><h3>How to use St Joseph to buy a house?</h3><p>In addition to praying, a common tradition is to bury a small statue of St. Joseph in the yard of the desired house. This is done as an act of faith and to seek St. Joseph’s intercession in the home-buying process. Once the house is bought, the statue can be given a special place of honor in the new home.</p><h3>How do you pray to St Joseph for a house?</h3><p>One prayer to St. Joseph for a house is: “St. Joseph, just and true, with a father’s care you raised the child Jesus, and with a husband’s love, you shared your life with Mary, his mother. I entrust myself to your care and place in your hands this request of mine to find housing for my family.”</p><h3>Do you bury St Joseph in the front or back yard?</h3><p>According to tradition, you should bury the St. Joseph statue in the front yard.
