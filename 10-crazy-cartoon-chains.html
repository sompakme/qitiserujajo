The artists on this list take that challenge quite seriously. Hip-Hop's love for cartoons is certainly lengthy, combining lowbrow pop-culture imagery with childhood nostalgia and diamond-draped&nbsp;luxury, the following rappers are owners of some of the&nbsp;wildest cartoon chains in the game.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some, like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Gucci Mane</a>, need no introduction, while others have seen their relevance dwindle after their lavish purchases. Rappers are often forced to grow up at an early age once their music starts to takeoff, these chains, however gaudy, may serve to remind them of simpler times when they didn't have to worry about tour dates, record sales and streaming numbers. Legendary jeweler Ben Baller even suggested as much of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a> in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">XXL</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, "Uzi’s so crazy and so confident and such a weird little kid, so unusual I love it so I’m like, 'Alright, fuck it'," explained Ben. "For Uzi’s piece, when he sent me the picture, I literally died. I was on the plane going back from London to L.A. dying laughing like, This little motherfucker!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That said, there's nothing simple about the chains on this list. Jewelry after all, is another way to compete in the rap game. Some have more money to spend on their ice than others, and some do it at a more frequent rate than others. This list isn't all about the cost however, and instead focuses on the uniqueness of each piece. &nbsp;There are dozens of others that could have made this list, and cities like Atlanta seemingly could support a list all their own. A select few jewelers are featured frequently throughout the list, with Ben Baller and Elliot Avainne both making multiple contributions. Making a list like this can be difficult because there are just so many fake chains in hip hop, which can certainly make you appreciate the incredible work of those jewelers mentioned above even more. Let us know in the comments who you think had the most unique piece on the list, and who donned their ice the best.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Here are some of the most animated chains in hip hop.&nbsp;</p><br><h2>Soulja Boy's <a href=# class=text-word>Mario</a> with Guns Chain</h2><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain. Soulja Boy can vouch for that. Once on top of the internet rap game Soulja has since become the punchline of many. His iced-out Mario chain, however, is no joke. Soulja's Mario doesn't have time to jump his way through the Mushroom Kingdom to save his princess. Instead, opting for a more Grand Theft Auto approach, Soulja bestowed him with two guns. Whether or not this chain is real or fake, its absurd enough&nbsp;to make&nbsp;this list.</p><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Breezy's bright pink Kirby chain answers the question of who he's rocking with on Super Smash Bros. They weren't many bright spots for Brown in 2010, in fact, his chain may be the only one.&nbsp;It happens to be one of several cartoon character-inspired chains that Brown has rocked over the years. He's been seen with Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear around his neck, as well as one of Peanuts' character Charlie Brown and even a mini Sonic the Hedgehog.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Quavo's Crash Bandicoot Chain & Ratatouille Chain</h2></p><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Quavo has a few cartoon chains worthy of this list. One of the more recent additions is his Crash Bandicoot chain, designed by Elliot Avianne. Quavo's chain game can be difficult to keep up with-- as you can see in the images above. In addition to Bandicoot, he also reps an iced out Yoda head, the famous blinged-out Ratatouille chain, sometimes rocking both at the same time, as seen above. Maybe it's time to get <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a> their own cartoon?</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A post shared by QuavoHuncho (@quavohuncho) on Jun 26, 2017 at 8:37pm PDT</p><h2>Lil Yachty's Bart Simpson Chain</h2><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">An ode to Gucci Mane's "Iced-Out Bart," Yachty's new chain takes it a step further by giving the Simpson's troublemaker Yachty's signature hairstyle. Yachty's neck decor is also more three dimensional than Gucci's original but both are sure to turn some heads in the club. Gucci is seemingly giving Atlanta's new wave tips on their rhyme schemes as well as their neck-wear.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A post shared by King boat (@lilyachty) on Jun 10, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A post shared by Jon Guven (@jonnyg78) on Jun 10, 2017 at 4:43pm PDT</p><h2>Gucci Mane's Odie Chain and Bart Simpson Chain</h2><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Oh, you thought Gucci wasn't going to make the list? Think again. Gucci's outrageous Odie chain is in a class of its own, much like the man himself. Based on Garfield's sidekick, Odie, and paired with the aforementioned Bart Simpson chain, show Wop's affinity for childhood nostalgia and of course, diamonds. Gucci has also famously showed his chains love, notably launching a Twitter and Instagram page for his icy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Santa Claus chain.</a>&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Odie chain remains a classic.</p><p><h2>Yung Berg's Batman Chain</h2></p><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Remember Yung Berg? Perhaps he's most famous for repeatedly having his chains stolen, many think that this particular chain was snatched by U.K. rapper Rowdy-T. This is the man who previously stole his Transformer chain (seen above), then rapped about taking Berg's next piece before calling him a "Cupcake&nbsp;ass bitch." While Berg claims to have given away the ice to a kid for charity, not many were buying that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Waka Flocka's Fozzie Bear Chain</h2></p><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Waka Flocka Flame, who claims to have gotten his name from Fozzie Bear's popular catch phrase "Wocka Wocka Wocka" paid his respects in every sense of the word when he dropped over $100,000 on the most gangster muppet you've ever seen. Wake has never been much for subtleties, this chain is no exception. We also have to give a shout-out/honorable mentions to Waka's Pink Panther chain and his Looney Tunes' chain of the rooster Foghorn Leghorn (yes, apparently that's the rooster's name).</p><p><h2>Petey Pablo's Pinky & The Brain Chain</h2></p><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Petey Pablo's relevance may have faded, but here's hoping his Pinky & The Brain chain is still as bright as ever. Sadly, much like the show itself, Petey's career was done after four seasons. That said I'm here for this legendary chain, even if it wasn't the most cerebral purchase.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Lil Uzi Vert's Cartoon Self Chain</h2></p><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Back in October of last year, Lil Uzi linked with Ben Baller to create a cartoon version of the "Money Longer" artist. The portrait was inspired by the artwork from Uzi's sophomore album, Lil Uzi Vert Vs. The World, itself inspired by the movie Scott Piglrim Vs. The World.&nbsp;Ben, who is no stranger to creating extravagant chains called the Uzi piece some of his finest work. Ben Baller called the chain one of the three best pieces of work he's done.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A post shared by BEN BALLER (@benballer) on Oct 5, 2016 at 10:10am PDT</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A post shared by BEN BALLER (@benballer) on Oct 3, 2016 at 10:46am PDT</p><h2>Offset's Freakazoid Chain</h2><p>10 Crazy Cartoon Chains</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You knew the Migos were going to claim more than one spot on this list, right? The group is no stranger to ice with each member sporting an impressive collection of links. Offset himself also owns the famed rain drop necklace that's really more of an ice drop, judging by the diamond count. However, our favorite chain of Set's has to be his Freakazoid chain inspired by the villain from <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Disney's The Incredibles</a>. There's also going to be&nbsp;a sequel to the early 2000's blockbuster releasing in 2018, so perhaps&nbsp;Offset will be inspired to get another character from the new movie to match.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZYJyhYxqZ2abopbHunnCmqmtp5%2BjeqS0wKKlrGWemsS0</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-crazy-cartoon-chains.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-crazy-cartoon-chains.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-crazy-cartoon-chains.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-crazy-cartoon-chains.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-crazy-cartoon-chains.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-crazy-cartoon-chains.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-vestidos-de-pasarela-que-querr%C3%A1s-tener.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-vestidos-de-pasarela-que-querr%C3%A1s-tener.html>15 vestidos de pasarela que querrs tener</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
