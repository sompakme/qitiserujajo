The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">61-year-old country singer</a> and actor confirmed his engagement on November 16, 2022.</p><p>The two actually got engaged back in August without an engagement ring. However, he and the Australian singer have made things official with both a gorgeous ring and an official announcement.</p><p>Firerose has sparked some curiosity, given her whirlwind relationship with Cyrus. She and Cyrus bear some similarities as they are both passionate singers and songwriters.</p><p>The two originally met back when Cyrus was filming Hannah Montana and reunited for a music collaboration in 2021. The result of their collaboration was a single titled New Day.</p><p><a href=#>Before their engagement</a>, the two are believed to have started dating around the same time as their first musical collaboration. Meanwhile, the two have continued to collaborate on music together and recently released a second single, Time.</p><p>Here’s everything to know about Firerose and her relationship with Cyrus.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-firerose-s-real-name>What is Firerose’s real name?</h2><p>Firerose is the stage name the singer uses in her career. Her real name is believed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">be Johanna Rosie Hodges</a>, which is the name she is sometimes credited with on her music tracks.</p><p>However, she hasn’t personally confirmed her legal name. While she hasn’t been keen on advertising her real name, she has discussed her childhood a bit.</p><p>On her website, she explained that she was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">born in Sydney, Australia</a> but raised in Nashville, Tennessee. She grew up in a family of symphony musicians, which gave her an early introduction to music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Despite moving to the United States as a child, she returned to her home country for college. Firerose is a graduate of the prestigious Newtown School for the Performing Arts in Australia.</p><p>After her graduation, she returned to the United States, where she kicked off her music career.</p><p>Before she collaborated with Cyrus, she released a handful of solo tracks beginning in 2019. Some of her works include Fragile Handling and Way Out. However, she described 2021 as her breakthrough year given her work with Cyrus.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-is-firerose>How old is Firerose?</h2><p>Despite her high-profile relationship with Cyrus and her music career, Firerose has kept many details of her life private. Just as her legal name is hard to confirm, so is her age.</p><p>However, her age has most frequently been reported as 34. This makes her just a little more than half of Cyrus’ age.</p><p>She is within the age range of Cyrus’ five children – Miley, Noah, Trace, Brandi, Christopher Cody, and Braison. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Noah is his youngest</a> child at 22 and Brandi is the oldest at age 35.</p><p>Fortunately, Firerose and Cyrus don’t seem bothered by their age difference at all. On October 18, Firerose took to Instagram to subtly show off her engagement ring with a sizeable rock in it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The two have also expressed their joy at being able to pursue their passion for music together as they continue to collaborate on new works.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Now that they have made their engagement official, they are bound to share more of their collaborations and adventures in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6cnKWdkqe2tcWOsJ%2BoZZmoeqe10Z6pqKuVYrWmvsSsZLCgkal6tbuMpKWor12Wr7DB02aZoqScrnqzrdhmmrKqpah6r7HWZp2imZ6YsqZ7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-firerose-here-s-what-to-know-about-billy-ray-cyrus-new-fianc%25C3%25A9e.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-firerose-here-s-what-to-know-about-billy-ray-cyrus-new-fianc%25C3%25A9e.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-firerose-here-s-what-to-know-about-billy-ray-cyrus-new-fianc%25C3%25A9e.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-firerose-here-s-what-to-know-about-billy-ray-cyrus-new-fianc%25C3%25A9e.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-firerose-here-s-what-to-know-about-billy-ray-cyrus-new-fianc%25C3%25A9e.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-firerose-here-s-what-to-know-about-billy-ray-cyrus-new-fianc%25C3%25A9e.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-cm-punk-was-paired-with-paul-heyman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-cm-punk-was-paired-with-paul-heyman.html>Why CM Punk Was Paired with Paul Heyman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-abby-lee-miller.html>What Happened To Abby Lee Miller?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-abby-lee-miller.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
