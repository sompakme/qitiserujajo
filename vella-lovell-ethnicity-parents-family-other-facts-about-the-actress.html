TV’s hit shows.&nbsp;A combination of growing demographic diversity and the renaissance of television, which has created the need for many actors and actresses, has resulted in a reality where fresh faces are the main acts on television shows.&nbsp;One of these fresh faces is Vella Lovell;&nbsp;The New Mexico native is the actress who plays Rachel Bloom’s wise neighbor in&nbsp;</span><span>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (2015)</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;For more information on this damsel, scroll down for more information.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Vella Lovell’s Biography (Ethnicity)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Vella Lovell is an actress of African and European descent often confused with a South Asian descent because of her skin color.&nbsp;She was born on September 13, 1985 in New Mexico, USA.&nbsp;At the moment there is hardly any information about the details of her childhood and so not much is known about her immediate family, they have completely disappeared from the radar.</span></p><p><span>Vella fell in love with art from a young age and devoted herself to mastering her passion.&nbsp;She attended Interlochen Arts Camp and then Interlochen Arts Academy, where she graduated before earning a bachelor’s degree from New York University.&nbsp;After graduating from New York University, she attended the famous Julliard art school and graduated in 2015.</span></p><p><span>Although her first foray into art was as a concert pianist, she gave up interest in theater.&nbsp;While continuing through her various stages of training, Vella Lovell auditioned for several plays and was cast in the play in 2009.&nbsp;</span><span>The Bacchae</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;She performed alongside Jonathan Groff in Central Park at the Delacorte Theater.&nbsp;She had another appearance in&nbsp;</span><span>The Great Recession</span><span>&nbsp;, a one-act play at the Flea Theater in New York.</span></p><p><span>Her performances in various
