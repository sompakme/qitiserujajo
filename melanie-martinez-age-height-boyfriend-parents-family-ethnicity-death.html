Her video for the song was funded by fans through an Indiegogo page.&nbsp;The video has since been viewed over 100 million times.&nbsp;She was then signed to Atlantic Records in April 2014 and released her debut EP Dollhouse in May of the same year.&nbsp;The EP’s single&nbsp;</span><span>Karussell</span><span>&nbsp;received a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</span></p><span>The album&nbsp;</span><span>Scream Baby</span><span>&nbsp;was released on August 14, 2015 and debuted at number 6 on the Billboard 200. She had released the singles Pity Party and Sippy Cup prior to the album’s release and they had done well on various charts.&nbsp;In 2016, the singer released a commercial for a product called Cry Baby Perfume Milk, a perfume she said she had been thinking about releasing since she finished writing her album.&nbsp;In November of the same year, she released a second EP called Cry Babys Extra Clutter.</span><p><span>Melanie Martinez was accused of sexual assault and rape at the hands of a woman named Timothy Heller in 2017.&nbsp;The singer had once shared a friendship with the accuser and responded to the allegations with shock, sadness and a statement that everything they shared had been approved by Heller.&nbsp;Her song&nbsp;</span><span>Piggyback</span><span>&nbsp;releasing on Soundcloud after the heat of the allegations was seen as a response to the claim.</span></p><h2><strong><span>family – parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>Melanie Martinez was born to Murcy Martinez’s mother and Jose Martinez’s father.&nbsp;Her family came from the Dominican Republic and Peurto Rico.&nbsp;When their daughter was four years old, they moved to Long Island, New York with their family.&nbsp;They also nurtured their daughter’s up-and-coming talent by introducing her to a wide range of music from an early age.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Melanie Martinez’s boyfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Apparently, Melanie Martinez doesn’t date that many.&nbsp;She has been linked to a man, music producer Michael Keenan, since 2015.&nbsp;The two had started dating in mid-2015, but she didn’t confirm her relationship with him on Twitter until February 2016.&nbsp;Michael Keenan shares most of their relationship on his own Instagram.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Melanie Martinez stands at 5 feet 2 inches, or 157 cm, and weighs 46 kg.&nbsp;She is not known to be particularly mindful about her food choices and has even stated that she hates vegetables, but she maintains an active lifestyle which seems to keep her fit.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Melanie Martinez’s Death Real?</span></strong></h2><p><span>In early 2018, Melanie Martinez searched Google might have a death date of April 4th, but the singer is very much alive.&nbsp;It turned out to be an unfortunate mix-up after a 3-year-old named Melanie Martinez was shot and killed and their identities got mixed up and switched.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
