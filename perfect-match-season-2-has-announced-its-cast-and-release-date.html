The omnibus dating experience created a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/perfect-match-cast/>season 1 cast</a> by bringing together alumni from the streaming giant's various reality series for a vacation à la Bachelor in Paradise and Love Island, where they all flirted and competed to find their perfect match. Season 1, which premiered on the platform in February 2023, was the ultimate mindless reality TV, hitting the sweet spot between relentless drama and discourse fuel about the show villains' gameplay (as well as its unfortunate <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/strong-black-women-perfect-match/>racial blindspot</a>).</p><p>Netflix knows when it has a hit, and after season 1 became one of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g26742354/best-reality-shows/>best reality shows</a> of last year, the streamer quickly began preparing for another installment. Read on for everything we know about Perfect Match season 2.

Perfect Match's first season racked up over 24 million hours watched in its first week and 39 million in its second, despite going up against powerhouse shows like You, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/physical-100-season-3/>Physical: 100</a>, Outer Banks, and its genre-mate Love Is Blind: After the Altar.

This means that several of the new cast may be new faces to viewers—unless they've tuned into more recent shows like The Trust, Surviving Paradise, Dated & Related, or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/squid-game-the-challenge-season-2/>Squid Game: The Challenge</a>.</p><p>Still, the streaming giant has gathered a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/perfect-match-season-2-cast/>compelling cast</a>, including several, previously announced former Love Is Blind contestants: season 4's Micah Lussier, season 5's Izzy Zapata, and season 6's Jessica Vestal. There's also a major shake-up for those more familiar with the Netflix universe of influencers, as both Too Hot to Handle's Harry Jowsey and Perfect Match season 1 winner Dom Gabriel have joined the cast.</p><span class=youtube-video-title>Perfect Match S2 | Cast Announcement | Netflix - YouTube</span> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.youtube.com/vi/mFoz7g02asI/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Perfect Match S2 | Cast Announcement | Netflix - YouTube" data-aspect-ratio=16/9 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a class=watch-on-youtube-mFoz7g02asI href=# data-url=https://youtu.be/mFoz7g02asI referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Watch On</a><p>For those less familiar with the IRL goss, Dom, previously best known for The Mole, was the Perfect Match season 1 winner when he and THTH's Georgia Hassarati were voted the perfect match. Not long after the show, the two broke up, and she went on to date THTH's Harry Jowsey for a period.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

By mid-2022, Georgia began dating Harry, whom she met during an appearance on his Boyfriend Material podcast. Dom has said he was "blindsided" by her new relationship with Harry, while Georgia has said she and Dom were "at different levels of the relationship."</p><p>To add more fuel to the fire, Dom and Harry share another ex: season 1 star Francesca Farago.</p><p>So Perfect Match season 2's cast includes standouts from the buzziest Netflix shows, people entering with (relative) clean slates, and two sides of an epic love triangle. This is going to be interesting.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-39-perfect-match-39-season-2-3>Is there a trailer for 'Perfect Match' season 2?</h2><span class=youtube-video-title>Perfect Match S2 | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube</span> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.youtube.com/vi/TAR70HmieZc/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Perfect Match S2 | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube" data-aspect-ratio=16/9 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a class=watch-on-youtube-TAR70HmieZc href=# data-url=https://youtu.be/TAR70HmieZc referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Watch On</a><p>You bet there is! Netflix dropped a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAR70HmieZc" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>trailer</a> on May 21, two and a half weeks ahead of the June 7 premiere date. With clips of wild challenges, body shots, toe-sucking, and hookups that seem to shock the group, it promises everything a fan of Netflix reality shows could want.</p><p>It’s hard to say who might be coupling up this season from the trailer, but it does seem to imply a handful of pairings. Based on the brief teaser, there might be sparks (or at least brief flirtations) between Chris and Tolú, Stevan and Xanthi, Christine and Kaz, and Jessica and Harry—but also maybe Harry and Micah. Meanwhile, former Love Is Blind antagonist Trevor admits that he's there "to redeem [himself.]"</p><p>There's ultimately no way to predict what will go down on the chaotic series, but at least we have the trailer to mull over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.youtube.com/vi/mFoz7g02asI/maxresdefault.jpg><h2 id=where-was-39-perfect-match-39-season-2-filmed-3>Where was 'Perfect Match' season 2 filmed?</h2><p>After<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/where-was-perfect-match-filmed/> season 1 of Perfect Match was filmed</a> at a lavish location in Panama City, Panama known as the Casa Naga, season 2 brought its looking-for-love hopefuls to an entirely new locale.

Many suspected that filming took place in August and September last year since several cast members, such as Harry Jowsey, posted photos on their Instagrams from what appeared to be in the same spot in Tulum.</p><p>It's yet to be confirmed where exactly season 2 was filmed, but according to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.distractify.com/p/where-was-perfect-match-filmed referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Distractify</a>, it seems as though the contestants shacked up at the luxury vacation villa <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.villasofdistinction.com/villa/riviera-maya/puerto-aventuras/hacienda-del-mar referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Hacienda Del Mar</a>.

They match up, even though Stevan was matched with Xanthi Perdikomatis of The Circle, and Alara was intrigued by Dom Gabriel. After the first six episodes of Perfect Match season 2, they seem to be one of the strongest, most lovable couples in the villa, but TBD if they'll remain that way.
