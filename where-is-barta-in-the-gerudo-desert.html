She is underneath the head of the fossil. Talk to her twice and give her the Hearty Durian.</p><h3>Why can’t i find Barta?</h3><p>You can find Barta at the mouth of the Gerudo Great Skeleton to the far southwest, just outside the Hawa Koth Shrine. She is underneath the head of the fossil. Talk to her twice and give her the Hearty Durian.</p><h3>Where is Barta after the Yiga clan hideout?</h3><p>Barta is under the skull of the Gerudo Great Skeleton, the Leviathan Bones in southwest Gerudo Desert. The quickest way to get here is to fast travel to the Hawa Koth Shrine, but be sure to select appropriate armor for either heat or cold depending on the time of day. Once you find Barta, give her the Hearty Durian.</p><h3>Can you free Barta in breath of the wild?</h3><p>Accepted Answer. The only prisoner in the Yiga Clan’s hideout is Barta. But she’ll be able to escape on her own once you’ve gotten what Riju wants you to recover.</p><h3>How do you give Barta the Hearty Durian?</h3><p>Once you find Barta, you see that she is dehydrated and is asking for a hearty durian. Retrieve a hearty Durian from the Gerudo town market for 60 rupees and head back to Barta. Once you reach Barta again, hand her the hearty durian so she can make her way back home.</p><h3>The Search For Barta -Wasteland Quests – The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3><p>Barta can be found at the mouth of the Gerudo Great Skeleton to the far southwest, just outside the Hawa Koth Shrine. She is underneath the head of the fossil. Talk to her twice and give her the Hearty Durian.</p><h3>How do you find Barta?</h3><p>Barta can be found at the mouth of the Gerudo Great Skeleton to the far southwest, just outside the Hawa Koth Shrine. She is underneath the head of the fossil. Talk to her twice and give her the Hearty Durian.</p><h3>Where is the best location for Hearty Durians?</h3><p>Where to find Hearty Durians. In a game where commodities are hard to come by, the Hearty Durians have a reliable and initially bountiful spawn point. You can easily find the home of the durians near Faron Tower, which is located southeast of the Great Plateau.</p><h3>Is there a Yiga Clan mask?</h3><p>The Yiga Mask is a primary piece of the uniform of the elusive Yiga Clan. The masks have become increasingly more common as relics of Hyrule have emerged and the Yiga have become more active. The origins of the Yiga Mask in False God Passage are unknown.</p><h3>Can you get a Yiga Mask in Breath of the Wild?</h3><p>To get the Yiga Mask, you’ll first need to head to Link’s original starting area from Breath of the Wild: The Great Plateau. To get there, head south from Lake Kolomo, approach the Gatepost Town Ruins, and skim the edge of the wall until you find a large pile of rubble with water bursting from the cracks.</p><h3>Where is the Yiga helmet?</h3><p>The Yiga Mask is found between Mount Hylia and Lake Hylia, in a Yiga Clan cabin surrounded by wooden spikes (Old Man’s Cabin from BOTW).</p><h3>Where is the Yiga Clan outfit?</h3><p>You can find the Yiga Armor inside a Yiga Clan hideout in Akkala Highlands at the coordinates (4501, 3143, 0245). While you can get to it through the Depths by ascending from underneath, there’s an easier method. First, you can use the Ulri Mountain Skyview Tower nearby to get closer.</p><h3>Can you just fight the Yiga Clan?</h3><p>Yes, it’s possible to kill all the Yiga after they spot you. I managed to do this, although I didn’t venture into the Yiga fortress until relatively late in the game. The gear I had was: Upgraded ‘Stasis’ rune.</p><h3>What is the secret code in Gerudo Town?</h3><p>Link can learn that the password is “GSC♦” during this Side Quest by eavesdropping on a group of Gerudo in The Noble Canteen. The manager of the Club, Greta, will allow Link to enter with this password. Upon entering and speaking to Greta, she notices that she hasn’t seen Link before and welcomes him as a member.</p><h3>Where is the great Gerudo skeleton?</h3><p>Gerudo’s Colossal Fossil Location in TotK. Head on over to the Gerudo’s Colossal Fossil in the Gerudo region, whose exact location is at the coordinates -3882, 3697, 0222. It is hard to miss the entrance in the desert, so go inside and look for Loone at the campfire.</p><h3>How do I get to Gerudo skeleton?</h3><p>The Gerudo Great Skeleton is in the far southwest of Gerudo Wasteland. For this one, Link is going to need the help of a Sand Seal. There are two Sand Seals outside Gerudo Town. Equip gear that raises Stealth (like the Stealth Set) and sneak up on the Sand Seals.</p><h3>Can you get a Yiga Clan outfit?</h3><p>When you get to the lab, walk up to the door and knock on it to alert the Yiga Clan members to your presence. Again, you will need to defeat the two Clan members that appear. Once you’ve done this, head inside the lab and speak to Konba on the left to claim the Yiga Armor chest piece.</p><h3>Is Zelda in the Yiga Clan?</h3><p>Much of the Yiga forces make up The Depths in outpost and territories all across the dark lands. Most Travelers Link can interact with while uncovering The Depths are Yiga in disguise when prompted conversation. Other Yiga members have expanded their list of disguises, such as Princess Zelda and a set of trees.</p><h3>How do you get full Yiga Armor?</h3><p>To get the final piece of this set, you need to head to the Akkala Ancient Tech lab to get the Yiga Armor chest piece in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. This can be found in the north east section of Deep Akkala. The lab is east of Death Mountain, north east of Akkala Highlands, and north of East Akkala Stable.</p><h3>Where can I buy Yiga leggings?</h3><p>You can find the Yiga Tights in the Yiga Clan Maritta Branch, which is a cave located in Aldor Foothills at the coordinates (-0643, 2032, 0157), located southeast of the Snowfield Stable at the Tabantha Tundra and west of the Great Hyrule Forest.</p><h3>What is the easiest mask</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6wn56qlWK2tHnBmqmtmV2eu27Ax55koJ2iqrGwecOeqp6qpGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-barta-in-the-gerudo-desert.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-is-barta-in-the-gerudo-desert.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-barta-in-the-gerudo-desert.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-is-barta-in-the-gerudo-desert.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-barta-in-the-gerudo-desert.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-barta-in-the-gerudo-desert.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-matt-olson-s-wife-nicole-olson-braves-baseman-s-personal-life-explored.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-matt-olson-s-wife-nicole-olson-braves-baseman-s-personal-life-explored.html>Who is Matt Olson's wife, Nicole Olson?
