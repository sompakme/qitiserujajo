People who were looking to fill their time with nothing else to do for entertainment. I couldn't understand how people had the time? Weren't we all too busy? Aren't hobbies too expensive? Or not readily available in conjunction with modern city life?</p><p id=elwTEf5imbQ data-wc=20>Even if you did have the time, who has the energy? The mental capacity to do something 'just for fun'?&nbsp;</p><p id=ed2fJD_ePS data-wc=10><strong>HATTIE'S COLUMN:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How can I stop comparing myself to others?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eKS2-7HX-0n data-wc=45>I now see how sad that sounds. I had my priorities all wrong. I wore my exhaustion like a badge of honour. My ridiculously busy diary was a testament to how 'happy'&nbsp;I was and 'well in life' I was doing. Does this sound familiar?</p><p id=elMLQMnMGji data-wc=15>So how did I come to this realisation and what was my catalyst for change?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37f519befff0-hiking-hattie.jpg><h2><strong>The catalyst for change</strong></h2><p id=eGWT59j1ur_o data-wc=55>Once I arrived in my new town, reality hit me pretty quickly. I had no friends. Not a single person I knew to call for a walk or a coffee. My sink or swim mentality kicked in, and I wrote a list of all the ways I could get out there and meet new friends.</p><p id=eAAJEBhpAky1 data-wc=22>Coming from a life with no shortage of close wonderful friends, the concept of having none was scary and alien to me.</p><p id=eMbrZXh7w897 data-wc=53>My list of ways to meet friends included new sports, creative activities and trying to find places I could surround myself with like-minded people. At the beginning I tried everything from Pilates to sea swimming, pottery to bee-keeping. The best thing is that since throwing myself in, I haven't stopped to look back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3987e2fc9c2-hattie-hobbies.jpg><p id=eNitHoZ72Zep data-wc=11>These are the biggest benefits I've found from trying new hobbies</p><h3><strong>1. Meeting new people</strong></h3><p id=elmqOs0vNcdv data-wc=43>Meeting a whole range of new, interesting and different people has been one of my favourite aspects of trying new things. I have met people from all walks of life, that I wouldn't have had the opportunity had I not just said 'yes'.</p><p id=euEAvFeKLuAm data-wc=33>Women both older and younger than me, with different attitudes and perspectives. I have learnt so much about myself and others, and the more I put myself out there the easier it became.</p><p id=ezUvu01KQ2nq data-wc=45>Making new friends as an adult can be scary, and something a lot of people in new environments struggle with. Connecting over a common activity is such a simple, beneficial way to cut through the small talk and increase your chances of meeting like-minded people.</p><p id=ejIFc7O6UH data-wc=18><strong>HATTIE'S ADVICE: <a class=hm-link href=#>I cleared my 'incurable' brain fog and eased my anxiety in 10 minutes – here's how&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h3><strong>2. Learning to prioritise yourself</strong></h3><p id=eDpH2godscx- data-wc=105>One of my favourite mottos is 'self-care isn't selfish', and now more than ever this rings true for me. It's so easy for us to lose ourselves in the daily stresses of life, without looking out for ourselves or prioritising our own needs. Just taking an hour for you, even if it's just once a week, to do something you actually enjoy and makes you feel good is so worthwhile. Focusing on your happiness, even if it’s just for a short time, will allow you to be a better version of you, a better wife, mum, friend, daughter – and there's nothing selfish about that!</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h3><strong>3. A chance to switch off</strong></h3><p id=eGXRafh0HKig data-wc=43>Whether you dabble in gardening, join a netball club or pick up a paintbrush – it's likely that your new hobby will get you off a screen and create space for some calm in your mind. You can't put a price on that!</p><p id=eRfe5ch4Om data-wc=14><strong>INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I ditched my phone for a whole week – here's what I learned</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>4. Having FUN!</strong></h3><p id=ecNcMvZOmqJm data-wc=33>As adults we can become so stuck in our ways. We've learnt what we're good at and to avoid what we're not. Perhaps for fear of judgement, looking silly or being laughed at.</p><p id=eYgkV0tY9KmW data-wc=43>When was the last time you let your guard down and just had FUN? Pure, unadultered, silly happy fun. Nothing will give you an endorphin hit or boost your dopamine like learning a new skill or trying something out of your comfort zone.</p><h3><strong>5. Shifting your focus</strong></h3><p id=eJ5tQwp78bji data-wc=38>When I look back at my old life, I'm not sure what I was so busy doing. I just remember being busy. I have consciously re-focused my priorities, in order to start actually enjoying life and feeling happy.</p><p id=eT6tcFMSW5-m data-wc=33>I have made several lifestyle changes (prioritising sleep, no alcohol and more daily movement to name a few) and this has given me the gift of time, and time feeling energised and happy.</p><p id=e0j8kJ29LeIe data-wc=45>So whether I use this new sense of freedom to make something funky in a pottery class, spend some time in the garden trying to grow vegetables or hiking a harder route, I know that my mind body and soul are all reaping the rewards.</p><p id=e8tUyrSU9F data-wc=14><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Follow Hattie on Instagram here</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">find out how to work with her here</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
