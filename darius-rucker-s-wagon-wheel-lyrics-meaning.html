He also references that he is “running from the cold up in New England”.&nbsp;So another reason he is trying to make it to Raleigh, North Carolina besides meeting up with his lady would be because the winters tend to be more agreeable down south.&nbsp; Indeed it could be said that he’s looking forward to starting a whole new life in Raleigh.&nbsp;In fact interesting to note is that Ketch Secor, the teenager (at the time) who actually wrote the verses of this song, did so while he was&nbsp;“flunking math”&nbsp;and basically daydreaming about escaping from school.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Narrator’s Primary Objective</h3><p>But as is clearly illustrated by the chorus, what he is looking forward to most is being ‘rocked’ by his “mama”.&nbsp;Now we can tell you that in this case “mama” would be a colloquialism for his girlfriend.&nbsp; And with that in mind, we don’t feel a need to expound on what he means in terms of being ‘rocked’.&nbsp; Indeed the title of this song is actually a metaphor for how the narrator wants to bump and grind, shall we say, with his lover like a “wagon wheel” on the road.</p><p>So basically, the way this song is structured is that the chorus centers primarily on why the singer wants to meet up with his lover.&nbsp;Meanwhile the verses mention some of the details concerning the journey it takes in order for him to reach her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Wagon-Wheel.png><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Writing Credits for “Wagon Wheel”</h3><p>The chorus of this track was written and recorded by Bob Dylan way back in 1973.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>It was conceptualized</a>&nbsp;to be part of the soundtrack to “Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid” (1973).&nbsp;It was never officially released but did come out as a bootleg entitled “Rock Me, Mama”.</p><p>The rest of the track was written some 25 years later by a musician named Ketch Secor.&nbsp;He and his band, Old Crow Medicine Show, were actually the first ones to record “Wagon Wheel” and release it in 2004.&nbsp;It went on to become&nbsp;the group’s signature tune, being certified Platinum in the United States.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Darius Rucker’s Version</h3><p>Meanwhile Darius Rucker, of&nbsp;Hootie & the Blowfish&nbsp;fame, dropped his own cover of “Wagon Wheel”, via Capitol Records Nashville, on 7 January 2013.&nbsp;It is featured on his fourth solo album, which is entitled “True Believers”.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p>Whereas Rucker had been familiar with “Wagon Wheel” for a minute, it never appealed to him to cover the tune&nbsp;until he heard&nbsp;a band comprised of faculty members from this daughter’s high school play a country rendition of the song.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>A Huge Success</h3><p>“Wagon Wheel” proved to be a bigger success for Darius Rucker than it did for Old Crow Medicine Show.&nbsp;For instance, it was nominated for a CMA Award and won a Grammy Award in 2014 in the category of&nbsp;Best Country Solo Performance. And in terms of the latter, Rucker holds the distinction of being only the second African-American to win a Grammy for vocals in a country-music song.&nbsp;(The first was Charley Pride, who did so&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in 1972</a>).</p><p>Moreover “Wagon Wheel” topped Billboard’s Canada Country chart as well as its&nbsp;Country Airplay&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hot Country Songs&nbsp;listings in the United States.&nbsp;It also peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 itself.</p><p>Even more astoundingly is that, as of early 2020, “Wagon Wheel” has been certified eight-times Platinum by the RIAA.&nbsp;The feat was so amazing that even Rucker himself&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>was amazed</a>.&nbsp;And it now holds the distinction of being one of the best-selling country songs in American history.</p><p>And just to note, “Wagon Wheel” has also been certified triple-platinum in Canada.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Music Video for “Wagon Wheel”</h3><p>Lee Tucker directed the music video to “Wagon Wheel”.&nbsp; It featured the cast of the reality television show “Duck Dynasty” as well as one member of Lady Antebellum, Charles Kelley.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Meanwhile the entirety of Lady Antebellum (Dave Haywood, Charles Kelly and Hillary Scott), amongst others, provided backup vocals to the song.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZp2Zop7CtHnRrpqknaKoeritxqilZq%2BYmrKtecuyqaKbo2K6pq3NoqWgZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdarius-rucker-s-wagon-wheel-lyrics-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdarius-rucker-s-wagon-wheel-lyrics-meaning.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdarius-rucker-s-wagon-wheel-lyrics-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdarius-rucker-s-wagon-wheel-lyrics-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdarius-rucker-s-wagon-wheel-lyrics-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdarius-rucker-s-wagon-wheel-lyrics-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./every-one-tree-hill-guest-star-turned-celebrity-you-totally-forgot-about.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./every-one-tree-hill-guest-star-turned-celebrity-you-totally-forgot-about.html>Every 'One Tree Hill' Guest Star-Turned-Celebrity You Totally Forgot About</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./amal-clooney-dazzles-in-chic-navy-to-unveil-life-changing-scholarship-for-aspiring-human-rights-la.html>Amal Clooney dazzles in chic navy to unveil 'life-changing' scholarship for aspiring human rights la</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./amal-clooney-dazzles-in-chic-navy-to-unveil-life-changing-scholarship-for-aspiring-human-rights-la.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
