A deck drainage system diverts water away from the joists and beams. An over-the-joist deck drainage system such as Trex RainEscape provides 100% protection from the damage caused by wood repeatedly getting wet.</span></span><h2>Is it better to stain or seal a deck?</h2>Deck sealing will protect the wood from splitting, cracking, moisture, mildew, and rot while maintaining the color and grain of the wood. A stain will protect the wood and provides a more uniform tint or color to the wood to complement surrounding structures.<h2>Should you waterproof a deck?</h2>The general rule of thumb is to get your deck waterproofed once a year, especially if you live in areas that see a lot of rainfall. Another thing to consider is whether or not you live in an area that gets a lot of direct sunlight year round.<h2>Is Thompsons water seal good for decks?</h2>Thompson's® WaterSeal® Maximum Strength Deck Stripper is the strongest option and will remove any coating - even a solid stain. If your deck is made of redwood or cedar,Thompson's® WaterSeal® 3 in 1™ Wood Cleaner will help restore those wood's natural color.<h2>What is the best time of year to seal a deck?</h2>Summer is generally the best time to waterproof your deck because it gives you the opportunity to clean it thoroughly and seal it properly without worrying about rain. It takes about two to three days for a deck to completely dry out after sealing and you'll need up to six days for it to be fully functional again.<h2>How To Protect Your Deck | Never Sand Again!</h2><p></p><h2>Which is better oil based or water based deck sealer?</h2>Water-based stains require a little more time and effort than oils, but it pays off with significantly greater durability. Oil based stains are easy to apply and take less effort, but they will not last nearly as long as a water based stain.<h2>Is Thompson's water seal better than stain?</h2>The advantage of this, they say, is the sealer provides additional protection against water and weather damage, while the stain helps reduce fading from UV rays. Sealers should last at least a year, with some lasting up to three years.<h2>Is there a water based deck stain?</h2>Water based decking stains have become increasingly popular in recent years due to stricter VOC laws in many states.

Cleanup is easy with mineral spirits. Water-based stains are better for cedar, cypress, and redwood as they are naturally protected from rot.<h2>Which deck stain lasts the longest?</h2>In general, an oil-based deck stain will last the longest, but it also depends on the type of wood, the weather conditions, and how long the deck has gone unprotected before staining.<h2>How long does water based stain last?</h2>Water-based stain will last 1 year, if opened, and 2 years, if unopened. Oil-based varnishes will be good for 1 year, opened or unopened. Opened cans of glazing compound will last for 1 year, unopened cans for 2 years, if kept above freezing.<h2>What is better than Thompsons water seal?</h2><p>According to them, these are the nine most effective wood sealers:</p><ul><li>Thompson's Water Seal. ...</li><li>Rainguard Premium Wood Sealer. ...</li><li>DEFY Crystal Clear Sealer. ...</li><li>Anchorseal 2. ...</li><li>Roxil Wood Protection Cream. ...</li><li>Eco-Advance Exterior Wood Waterproofer. ...</li><li>Ready Seal Stain and Sealer for Wood. ...</li><li>Pure Tung Oil Natural Wood Sealer.</li></ul><h2>What is the best way to protect a wood deck?</h2>The best preventative measure you can take to protect your wooden deck is to use wood sealant.

Whether you should oil or stain will come down to what you want from your deck. A stain will improve the appearance of the deck, but oil will better help preserve its condition.<h2>Can you put water based sealer over oil based sealer?</h2>It's a question we get often, actually—especially as more craftsmen are making the move to water-based finish.

This is because it is more durable than a water-base and will provide a more complete protective layer against these elements.<h2>How long does Thompson's water seal last?</h2>Water Seal can only be used on bare and uncoated brick, stone or concrete. How long will Water Seal last? If applied correctly, Water Seal will last up to 4 years. This is dependent on conditions such as orientation of the wall and local climate.<h2>How long does deck waterproofing last?</h2>The fact that longevity depends on how well the seams were welded,” according to Waterproof Magazine.
